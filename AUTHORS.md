The Python port of BlueButton.js would not be possible without the work of the
[BlueButton.js development team](https://github.com/orgs/blue-button/people).

Funding has been provided by the [University of Florida's Clinical and
Translational Science Institute](https://www.ctsi.ufl.edu) and the [OneFlorida
Clinical Research Consortium](https://onefloridaconsortium.org).

The initial porting work was done by [Taeber
